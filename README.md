# EyeTribeTestProject

I made a project with a few challenges using **The Eye Tribe** device with the purpose of acquiring knowledge with an eye tracking device. In a few weeks, I have developed this little project with some fun ideas that I had and that I think it could be used in a game environment.

I used Unity 2017.4.13f1 and c# .NET 3.5, with the Eye Tribe's extension library. You can find it in the **Plugin** folder.

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQdWoVWLeAs&feature=youtu.be) of the project.

# How to start

First you have to download and install [The Eye Tribe SDK.](https://github.com/EyeTribe/sdk-installers/releases) This software will provide you feedback from the device and helps with the calibration.

Something that I also downloaded, is their [Unity SDK for EyeTribe Dev Kit](https://github.com/EyeTribe/tet-unity-devkit), which provides an example project where I got to learn from and get to understand how the device works in Unity. You can find all the necessary components in the Eye Tribeâ€™s **Prefab** folder.
